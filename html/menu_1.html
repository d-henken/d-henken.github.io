      <h1>Harmony and Contrast</h1>
         <p>The heart of Carl Dair's teaching -- the thing that I keep pointing people to, and the most valuable thing I myself learned from his work -- is the subject of "A Typographic Quest" No. 5: "Typographic Contrast." In a virtuoso performance, Dair shows exactly how designers use different kinds of visual contrast to make design work and meaning pop out -- clearly and unambiguously, and with flair. To make his point, he compares typography to music.</p>

         <p>Graphic form and musical form have a common denominator: rhythm and emphasis, harmony and contrast. "Harmony and contrast," says Dair, "are fundamental to both, and the discovery of these basic principles and their application to the design of printed matter is the object of this volume of 'A Typographic Quest.'"</p>

        <h2>Seven Kinds of Contrast</h2>
          <p>Dair first explains the "elements of harmony" (a consistent relationship between the black strokes of the letters on a page and the space around them; and any rules, frames, or decorations being similar in style to the type), then goes on to show seven different kinds of contrast. He emphasizes that in any kind of differentiation, it's important to make the contrast obvious -- not just a slight change, an almost imperceptible variation, but a really big, obvious difference between the contrasting elements.</p>
        <h1><a href="./size.html">Contrast of Size</a></h1>
        <h1><a href="./weight.html"></a>Contrast of Weight</a></h1>
        <h1><a href="./form.html">Contrast of Form<</a></h1>
        <h1><a href="./structure.html">Contrast of Structure</a></h1>
        <h1><a href="./texture.html">Contrast of Texture</a></h1>
        <h1><a href="./color.html">Contrast of Color</a></h1>
        <h1><a href="./direction.html">Contrast of Direction</a></h1>
        <h1><a href="./types.html">Other Types of Contrast</a></h1>
          <p>Finally, Dair takes time to say a little about rhythm ("in typography, it consists of intervals of space") and about the power of "interrupted rhythm" ("the impact derives not from the fact that the unexpected happens, but rather that the expected does not happen").</p>

          <p>Most of the time, we use more than one kind of contrast together, in order to make the differences between visual elements even more obvious. We can use all of Dair's seven kinds of contrast at once, if we're skillful; he refers to this as typographic "chords." (One of the chapter titles in "Design With Type" is "Multiplying the Contrasts.") But breaking them down like this into simple oppositions makes it easier to use them consciously; it keeps us from getting our layouts all muddied up through trying to change too many things at once without thinking about what we're doing. I've found Carl Dair's analysis of typographic contrast -- and especially the visual flair with which he presents it -- an invaluable tool in the practice of graphic design.</p>
